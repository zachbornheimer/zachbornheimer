## 🏆 About Me

I specialize in cross-discipline innovation, often brought in to create the first drafts of projects that would typically require multiple experts across several fields. 

I am passionate about **building, scaling, and automating complex systems**, **detail-oriented work and its influence over the bigger picture**, and **building future-proof systems**.

In this approach, I've developed cross-discipline technology in encryption, anti-piracy, security, artificial intelligence / expert systems (Patent [US12175539B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220261923A1/en)), and more.

In my undergrad, I worked in pattern-driven natural language processing from a practical and theoretical perspective (see [Non-statistical Morpheme Candidate Extraction](https://www.academia.edu/6293789/Non_statistical_Language_Blind_Morpheme_Candidate_Extraction_An_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Approach) and [Linguistic Fusion: A Discovery Procedure, Unification Theory, and Formation Theory for all Human Languages](https://www.academia.edu/6895038/Linguistic_Fusion_A_Discovery_Procedure_Unification_Theory_and_Formation_Theory_for_all_Human_Languages)) which lead to discussing a potential doctorate in lingustics at MIT with Noam Chomsky.

Instead of pursuing a doctorate in linguistics, I was offered a fellowship in Jazz Composotion and Performance from the University of South Florida which I pursued and earned my Master's degree which kickstarted my musical career.  My eye for detail was honed during my degree and after in my profressional training and ongoing relationship with NEA Jazz Master and Multi-GRAMMY® winner Maria Schneider.

Currently, I serve as **CIO at IIP Group Holdings, Inc.**, where I drive **enterprise AI and automation strategies and technologies** in the InsurTech space.
